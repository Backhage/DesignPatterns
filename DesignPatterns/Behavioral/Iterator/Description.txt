Iterator Design Pattern
-----------------------

The iterator pattern is a design pattern in which an
iterator is used to traverse a container and access
the container's elements.

The iterator pattern decouples algorithms from containers;
in some cases, algorithms are necessarily container-specific
and thus cannot be decoupled.
