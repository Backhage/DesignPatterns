Decorator
---------

The decorator pattern (also known as
Wrapper, an alternative naming shared with the Adapter pattern) is a
design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object,
either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of
other objects from the same class.

The decorator pattern is often useful for adhering to the Single
Responsibility Principle, as it allows functionality to be divided
between classes with unique areas of concern.
