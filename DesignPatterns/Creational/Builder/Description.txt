Builder Design Pattern
----------------------

The builder pattern is an object creation software design pattern.
Unlike the abstract factory pattern and the factory method pattern
whose intention is to enable polymorphism, the intention of the
builder pattern is to find a solution to the telescoping constructor
anti-pattern. The telescoping constructor anti-pattern occurs when the
increase of object constructor parameter combination leads to an
exponential list of constructors.

Instead of using numerous constructors, the builder pattern uses
another object, a builder, that receives each initialization parameter
step by step and then returns the resulting constructed object at once.
