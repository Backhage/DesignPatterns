Factory Design Pattern
----------------------

A factory is an object for creating other objects – 
formally a factory is a function or method that returns
objects of a varying prototype or class from some method
call, which is assumed to be "new".

More broadly, a subroutine that returns a "new" object
may be referred to as a "factory", as in factory method 
or factory function. This is a basic concept in OOP, and
forms the basis for a number of related software
design patterns.
